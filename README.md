# VOID16 Pico Firmware

Made for the [VOID16](https://github.com/victorlucachi/void16) by victorlucachi

## QMK

All files required to compile QMK are located in the ``qmk`` folder. Clone the [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) repository, rename the folder to something else (like ``void16``), copy it into the ``keyboards`` directory and compile like you would with any other keyboard.

## VIA

Once you've flashed your VIA firmware, open [usevia.app](usevia.app) in a Chromium browser, go to Settings to enable the Design tab, go to the Design tab and upload the ``via.json`` from this repository - VIA should work as usual.
